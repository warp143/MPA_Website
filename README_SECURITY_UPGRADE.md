## 🚀 How to Execute

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# Wait until SSH is stable, then:
ssh -i ssh/proptech_mpa_new proptech@smaug.cygnusdns.com

# Run the automated script:
cd ~
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warp143/MPA_Website/main/implement_security_phases.sh
chmod +x implement_security_phases.sh
./implement_security_phases.sh
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Create backups automatically
2. ✅ Guide you through each phase
3. ✅ Show what needs manual editing
4. ✅ Verify changes
5. ✅ Test protection

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
# Download and follow the guide:
ssh -i ssh/proptech_mpa_new proptech@smaug.cygnusdns.com
cd ~/public_html/proptech.org.my
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warp143/MPA_Website/main/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
less SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Can't This Be Done Now?
- SSH connection is being rate-limited by server security (Wordfence/fail2ban)
- This is **GOOD** - shows your security is working!
- Wait 30-60 minutes for connection limit to reset

### Safety First
- ✅ All changes have backup procedures
- ✅ Changes are reversible
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms included
- ✅ No downtime expected
- ✅ Can be done in stages

### What You'll Need
1. **Access:** SSH to server (wait for rate limit reset)
2. **Time:** 5-6 hours total (can split across days)
3. **Backup:** Auto-created by script
4. **Testing:** 30 minutes after completion
