# 🛡️ Incident & Cleanup Report — October 28, 2025

## Executive Summary
On October 28, 2025, a second wave of malware re-infection was detected in the local WordPress development environment. Automated monitoring, active since the previous day’s cleanup, uncovered the appearance of multiple new ELF/Perl malware files even while the system was idle. Forensic analysis traced this unexpected reinfection to automatic extraction of infected backup ZIP files, caused by macOS system services (e.g. Spotlight, StreamingUnzipService). All backup sources were thoroughly purged, and continuous scan monitoring was implemented.

## Timeline of Events
| Time               | Event                                                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00:20 AM           | Automated scan detects 5 new malware files — system was idle (no user action)     |
| 01:02 AM           | Count increases to 9 malware files, simultaneous timestamp changes in key folders  |
| 01:15–2:20 AM      | Forensic investigation traces root cause to ZIP backup extraction                  |
| 02:25 AM           | All infected backup files deleted                                                  |
| 02:30–11:33 AM     | Hourly scans verify system remains clean                                           |

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Source**: Three infected backup ZIPs in `backup/` directory containing contaminated plugins/themes/uploads
- **Trigger**: macOS system service (Spotlight/QuickLook/StreamingUnzipService) automatically extracted ZIPs, restoring malware files into WordPress directory during system idle
- **Evidence**: Key parent directories (`plugin_env/`, `twentytwentyfive/`) showed identical, sudden timestamps, with no user-initiated processes; only system processes active
- **Resolution**: Deleted all infected backup ZIPs. Monitored and verified no further regeneration after files removed

## Artifacts & Technical Evidence
- **Malware types**: ELF 32/64-bit, Perl scripts, same build signatures as Oct 24–27
- **Locations**: `mpa-image-processor/plugin_env/`, `twentytwentyfive/styles/blocks/` and assets/fonts/
- **Monitoring outputs**: Hourly scan logs, stable file count, 0 malware detections across 9+ hours

## Remediation & Verification
- Deleted all infected backup files in all backup/ updraft/ and extracted folders
- Performed comprehensive scan of all plugin, theme, upload locations for known malware patterns, signatures, and suspicious file attributes
- Maintained hourly scan schedule for ongoing early detection
- System remained fully clean from 02:30 AM until end-of-day

## Key Lessons Learned
- Malware can persistently regenerate **without user interaction**, solely through OS/file manager activity
- **All backup sources must be fully purged before confirming a system is truly clean**
- Hourly monitoring and automated log review are effective for catching even stealthy/surprising reinfection events

## Recommendations
- When cleaning infected WordPress, always check if any ZIP/TAR/other backup files might contain contaminated files
- Purge, not just quarantine, all original backups after infection event
- Use continuous or at least daily scan automation for post-cleanup validation
