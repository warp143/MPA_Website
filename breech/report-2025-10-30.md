# 🛡️ Security Monitoring & Status Report — October 30, 2025

## Executive Summary
By October 30, 2025, Malaysia Proptech Association’s WordPress system remained in a clean, hardened state following the prior day’s comprehensive malware/backdoor cleanup and functional restoration. While several brute-force login attempts (targeting disabled accounts) were logged from international IPs, no new files, users, or malicious uploads were detected. System integrity, permissions, and firewall/WAF rules prevented further compromise.

## Timeline
| Time (MYT)         | Event                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 04:57–09:22 AM     | Multiple failed brute-force login attempts (IPs: HK, US, UK, etc) |
| (All day)          | Daily scan review — no new suspicious uploads or filesystem mods   |
| 12:45 PM           | Verification of clean status, screenshot and admin checks          |

## Key Findings & Actions
- **Brute-force attempts:**
    - 4+ failed login attempts against deleted `amk` user, all from foreign IPs
    - No login successes; web application firewall and permissions effective
    - Attack focus on outdated credentials (attacker appears to have only old intel)
- **No new uploads:**
    - Audited all recent uploads directories — no PHP/JS/HTML attacks in last 24h
    - Only legitimate plugin and system activity observed
- **No active compromise:**
    - Verified `functions.php`, `wp-config.php` for backdoor patterns and historic signatures—clean
    - No `root` or fake admin users present in system state
    - Wordfence WAF running, WordPress block rules active

## Security State & Recommendations
- Site remained **secure and operational** throughout the day
- Ongoing recommendations:
    - **Block repeated attacking IPs** using WAF/hosting firewall for ongoing login abuse
    - Continue daily log review for login events, new files, and user list changes
    - Keep `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` enabled in configuration
    - Maintain frequent admin password rotation and strong password policy
    - Monitor for any future brute-force patterns shifting to legitimate user names/attacks
