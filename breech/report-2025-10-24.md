# 🚨 Security Incident Report — October 24, 2025

## Executive Summary
On October 24, 2025, the Malaysia Proptech Association WordPress website (proptech.org.my) experienced a critical security breach, resulting in total server compromise and mass deployment of malware, including backdoors, cryptocurrency miners, and persistence mechanisms. The initial attack vector was compromised WordPress admin credentials, allowing the attacker to deploy malicious code, create a hidden administrator account ("root"), and leverage both filesystem and cron for persistence. Site outages and extreme server load quickly followed, necessitating immediate shutdown, forensic analysis, and response.

## Attack Vector & Attacker Behavior
- **Primary attack vector:** Stolen or brute-forced WordPress admin credentials (user: amk).
- **Attacker IP:** 217.215.115.218 (HK/foreign domain)
- **Immediate actions:**
  - Created persistent hidden user account ("root" with admin@wordpress.com) through injected backdoor in theme/plugin PHP (
    confirmed via forensic search & log analysis).
  - Uploaded multiple malware payloads through /wp-admin/async-upload.php (only admin users can perform).
  - Deployed: PHP backdoors, obfuscated shells (hex2bin-based), CMSmap shell, cryptocurrency (ELF/Perl) miners in plugin/theme dirs, cron jobs for persistence, hidden backup copy.
  - Infected core WordPress files (`class-wp-rest-post-statuses-controller.php`, `class-wp-rest-users-controller.php`) with code execution backdoors.
  - Created cron task: reruns Linux malware from disguised plugin paths every 15 min.
- **Persistence:**
  - Hidden admin user is auto-recreated by backdoor if deleted.
  - Miners/processes restarted persistently by cron.

## Artifacts & Forensic Evidence
**Malware Locations:**
- Plugins: `convertpro/assets/css/cloud.php`, `avmphku/index.php` (CMSmap shell), `updraftplus/vendor/**/main_center.php`
- Core: `wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/{...}` (backdoor code at line 1)
- Dozens of ELF/Perl files with random names in multiple plugin/theme folders
- Cron job: `/wp-content/plugins/mpa-image-processor.disabled/plugin_env/.../CommonAttributes` (ELF executable)
- Hidden backup folder detected: `/backup_site/`

**Indicators of Compromise:**
- Massive server load (Load 133.50+ vs. normal <1.0, memory exhaustion)
- Unexplained admin user "root" invisible in user list except through DB query
- File signatures: ELF 32/64-bit, Perl scripts, random 8-char filenames, hex2bin-
obfuscated PHP

**Key forensic commands:**
- Checked Apache access logs for login, POST upload events (matched attacker IP)
- `grep` for hex2bin/eval in all PHP files
- `find` for ELF/Perl files in plugins/themes
- Manually inspected core mods for first-line malware injection
- Database: Select for unknown/additional users, "root", auto-created users

## Emergency Actions Taken
- Immediate forensic snapshot: full copy of infected server state
- Malicious cron jobs identified and removed (partial success, some persistence remained)
- Deleted known malware files (20+ ELF/Perl, 3+ PHP backdoors in plugins, 2 core backdoors)
- Deleted "root" admin account in DB (persistence remained—later resolved)
- Created clean backup from local (cleaned) environment for restoration
- Server shut down for safety, communications with hosting initiated

## Lessons Learned (for post-24th response)
- **WordPress admin panel is a high-value attack target; do not allow uploads by untrusted users.**
- **Malicious persistence can be multi-layered and requires exhaustive forensics: theme, plugin, core mods, and system cron jobs.**
- **Backdoor user creation code abused legitimate WordPress APIs, making surface code reviews insufficient — search by behavioral patterns (auto user creation, eval, base64_decode, cron jobs, ELF/Perl binaries, invisible/unusual users).**

## Summary & Status (End of Day)
- **Site was fully compromised.**
- Complete server wipe recommended (malware regenerating, persistent cron jobs and system infection).
- Clean local backup and database exported for clean server rebuild.
