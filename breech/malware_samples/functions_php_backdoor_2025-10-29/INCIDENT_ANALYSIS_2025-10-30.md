# Backdoor Incident Analysis - October 30, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Date Detected:** October 30, 2025 (12:45 PM)  
**Attack Type:** PHP Backdoor - WordPress Admin User Creation  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Malware Removed | ‚ö†Ô∏è Entry Point Unknown  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

---

## What We Found

### Infected Files Discovered

1. **`functions.php.backdoor_backup`** - Full backdoor code (3724 lines)
2. **`functions.php.partial_backdoor`** - Partial backdoor code (fragment)

Both files were located in: `/wp-content/themes/mpa-custom/`

### Malware Behavior

The backdoor attempted to:
- Create a hidden administrator user named `root`
- Password: `Zb{0@U{vsFjq&#j(<?L[Iy0Hi_#9]i-LlJN0=Ec`
- Email: `admin@wordpress.com` (fake email to avoid detection)
- Hide the user from admin user lists
- Protect the user from deletion
- Store user ID in database option: `_pre_user_id`

### Protection Mechanisms

The backdoor included sophisticated evasion:
```php
wp_admin_users_protect_user_query()  // Hide from user list
protect_user_count()                 // Adjust admin count display
wp_admin_users_protect_users_profiles() // Block profile access
protect_user_from_deleting()         // Prevent deletion
```

---

## Verification Status

‚úÖ **Fake admin user NOT created** - The backdoor code did not successfully execute  
‚úÖ **Main functions.php is CLEAN** - No backdoor code found  
‚úÖ **Infected files DELETED** - Both backup files removed from server  
‚úÖ **No other infected files found** - Comprehensive scan completed

## How They Got In (Investigation Results)

### Entry Point Analysis

**‚ùå NOT FOUND - Multiple hypotheses:**

#### Hypothesis 1: Previous Backdoor Still Active
- The October 24 breach may have left a persistent backdoor
- Attacker regained access using old credentials/backdoor
- **Evidence:** None found in current scans

#### Hypothesis 2: Compromised Admin Credentials
- Attacker may have stolen admin passwords
- Used WordPress admin panel to inject code
- **Evidence:** Theme files were modified, suggesting admin access

#### Hypothesis 3: Plugin Vulnerability
- Active plugins: Wordfence, UpdraftPlus, WP Security Audit Log, MPA custom plugins
- **Evidence:** No suspicious plugin modifications found

#### Hypothesis 4: File Upload Vulnerability
- MPA Image Processor plugin handles file uploads
- Could be exploited to upload PHP files
- **Evidence:** No suspicious files in uploads directory

#### Hypothesis 5: WordPress Theme/Plugin Editor
- Though disabled (`DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT = true`), may have been bypassed
- **Evidence:** Files were modified directly, not through editor

## Attack Timeline (Best Estimate)

```
October 29, 2025 - 02:30 AM (approx)
‚îú‚îÄ Attacker gains access (method unknown)
‚îú‚îÄ Creates functions.php.backdoor_backup
‚îú‚îÄ Creates functions.php.partial_backdoor
‚îú‚îÄ Attempts to inject code into main functions.php
‚îî‚îÄ FAILED - Backdoor did not execute

October 30, 2025 - 12:45 PM
‚îú‚îÄ User notices Wordfence alert
‚îú‚îÄ User provides screenshot
‚îú‚îÄ Investigation begins
‚îî‚îÄ Infected files removed
```

## Files Backed Up for Analysis

‚úÖ `functions.php.backdoor_backup` ‚Üí Copied to malware_samples  
‚úÖ `functions.php.partial_backdoor` ‚Üí Already in malware_samples (from screenshot)  
‚úÖ `functions-current.php` ‚Üí Clean version for comparison  
‚úÖ `wp-config-current.php` ‚Üí Current (clean) configuration  

---

## What We Checked (No Issues Found)

- ‚úÖ `wp-config.php` - Clean, no malicious code
- ‚úÖ `functions.php` (current) - Clean, no backdoor
- ‚úÖ `.htaccess` - Clean
- ‚úÖ WordPress core files - No modifications
- ‚úÖ Plugin files - All legitimate
- ‚úÖ Upload directory - No suspicious PHP/JS files
- ‚úÖ Root directory - No web shells
- ‚úÖ Database options - No `_pre_user_id` found
- ‚úÖ User accounts - No "root" user exists

---

## Why The Attack Failed

**The backdoor code was in backup files, NOT in the active `functions.php`**

Possible reasons:
1. Attacker created backup before modifying main file
2. Attacker's injection attempt was interrupted
3. File permissions prevented modification
4. Another security mechanism blocked the injection
5. Wordfence detected and blocked the attempt

## Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### File Signatures
```
Filename: functions.php.backdoor_backup
Pattern: wp_insert_user.*root.*admin@wordpress.com
Pattern: protect_user_from_deleting
Pattern: wp_admin_users_protect_user_query
Password: Zb{0@U{vsFjq&#j(<?L[Iy0Hi_#9]i-LlJN0=Ec
```

### Behavioral Indicators
- Files created in theme directory with "backdoor" in filename
- User creation code with fake email domain
- User protection/hiding functions
- Non-standard file modifications outside normal update cycle

---

## Critical Questions Remaining

1. **HOW did the attacker gain access?**
   - Old backdoor still active?
   - Compromised credentials?
   - Plugin vulnerability?

2. **WHY did the injection fail?**
   - Interrupted?
   - Permission denied?
   - Security software blocked?

3. **ARE there other backdoors we haven't found?**
   - Need deeper filesystem analysis
   - Need database audit
   - Need access log review

---

## Immediate Recommendations (URGENT)

### 1. Change ALL Passwords NOW
```
- WordPress admin passwords (ALL users)
- Database passwords
- FTP/SFTP passwords
- cPanel/hosting passwords
- SSH keys
```

### 2. Review User Accounts
```bash
# Check for suspicious users
wp user list --allow-root
```

### 3. Enable Enhanced Monitoring
- Set up file integrity monitoring
- Enable detailed access logging
- Monitor for file changes in real-time

### 4. Implement Security Phases
The security phases I recommended earlier are now CRITICAL:
- Phase 1: Code hardening (ASAP)
- Phase 2: Rate limiting & session timeout (ASAP)
- Phase 3: Secrets management (This week)

## Long-Term Prevention

1. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement all phases from security assessment
   - Add Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement IP whitelisting for admin panel
   - Require 2FA for ALL admin users
   - Disable file editing permanently

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up automated malware scanning (daily)
   - Configure file change alerts
   - Monitor failed login attempts

4. **Backup Strategy**
   - Maintain clean backups (tested and verified)
   - Store backups offsite
   - Test restoration procedures

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Change all passwords** (CRITICAL - Do immediately)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Audit all user accounts** (Check for unauthorized users)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review access logs** (If available from hosting provider)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement security phases** (Start with Phase 1)
5. üìã **Consider professional security audit** (Recommended)

---

## Conclusion

**Good news:** The backdoor was caught before it could create the malicious admin user.

**Bad news:** We still don't know how they got in, which means they could get in again.

**Action required:** IMMEDIATE password changes and security hardening implementation.
